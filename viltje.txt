The viltje is currently using a modified version of the voltage curve characteristic (124) as input: send any number to start the ADC sampling. The result is send to the number2 characteristic (121).
The electrical scheme is as followes:

 Vcc --- [ 10k ohm ] --- ADC_PIN --- [ pressure sensor ] --- GND
